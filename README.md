# Cross-Selling with Machine Learning on Product Recommendation

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to identify cross-selling opportunities using transactional and campaign data. We apply market basket analysis and hybrid recommendation systems to deliver more personalized and effective product recommendations.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project explores how machine learning can support targeted marketing and cross-sell strategies by:

- Detecting frequently co-purchased items using association rules (Apriori, FP-Growth).
- Building hybrid recommendation systems combining collaborative filtering (KNN, SVD) with market basket logic.
- Analyzing coupon redemptions, customer demographics, and transaction patterns.
- Visualizing campaign effectiveness through Power BI dashboards.
