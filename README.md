# Cross-Selling with Machine Learning on Product Recommendation

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to identify cross-selling opportunities using transactional and campaign data. We apply market basket analysis and hybrid recommendation systems to deliver more personalized and effective product recommendations

---

🔧 Project Overview
- This project explores how machine learning can support targeted marketing and cross-sell strategies by:

- Detecting frequently co-purchased items using association rules (Apriori, FP-Growth).

- Building hybrid recommendation systems combining collaborative filtering (KNN, SVD) with market basket logic.

- Analyzing coupon redemptions, customer demographics, and transaction patterns.

- Visualizing campaign effectiveness through Power BI dashboards.

---

🎯 Project Impact
- 💡 Identified high-performing product combinations to boost cross-selling effectiveness.

- 📈 Enhanced customer engagement through more personalized recommendation strategies.

- ⏱ Reduced manual reporting workload and analysis time using automated pipelines.

- 📊 Delivered interactive dashboards to track real-time campaign and product performance, aiding strategic marketing decisions.

📊 Project Result
The Power BI dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive view of:

- Top Product Pairings: Highlights which products are frequently bought together.

- Customer Segmentation: Breakdown of demographic groups and their coupon usage behavior.

- Campaign Performance: Tracks metrics like coupon redemption rates, uplift, and revenue impact.

- Sales Trend Visualization: Enables stakeholders to monitor transaction volumes over time.

The dashboard equips decision-makers with actionable insights to optimize campaign targeting and improve ROI through data-backed cross-sell strategies.
