🔧 Project Overview
- This project explores how machine learning can support targeted marketing and cross-sell strategies by:

- Detecting frequently co-purchased items using association rules (Apriori, FP-Growth).

- Building hybrid recommendation systems combining collaborative filtering (KNN, SVD) with market basket logic.

- Analyzing coupon redemptions, customer demographics, and transaction patterns.

- Visualizing campaign effectiveness through Power BI dashboards.
